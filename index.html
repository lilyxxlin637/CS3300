Problem 1: Identity the valid javascript types and prove an example.
For each example use console.log(typeof()) to demonstrate it validity.
<script>
//boolean
console.log(typeof(true));
//function
function id(x) {return x};
console.log(typeof(id));
//number
console.log(typeof(1.0));
//object
var car = {color:"yellow"};
console.log(typeof(care));
//string
console.log(typeof("string"));
//undefined
console.log(typeof (asdf));
</script>

Problem 2: describe the error in each example and provide a fixed version.
Use JSON.parse() to demonstrate that it works
<script>
//a) keys must be strings and JSON.parse() requires strings as inputs.
JSON.parse('{"name":"Data-driven web applications"}');

//b) JSON.parse() requires strings as inputs.
//No comments are allowed in JSON files,
//but a new key,value pair could be constructed to store necessary information
JSON.parse('{ "comments":"/* the next variable is a course number */","number": 3300 }');

//c) The example did not use commas to seperate the list of objects.
//It also used ; instead of : between the key "number" and value 1110.
JSON.parse('[ { "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 },{ "name": "Java", "number": 2110 },{ "name": "Python", "number": 1110 }]')
</script>

Problem 3: write a JSON file that represents a list as required.
<script>
[{ "name": "Lily", "age": 20,"isCSMajor":true },
{ "name": "Jessica", "age": 19,"isCSMajor":false },
{ "name": "Krystal", "age": 19,"isCSMajor":false}]
</script>
